# terraform-for-advanced-class-
This is a demo project used to provision a regular jenkins EC2 server using terraform (HashiCorp's infrastructure as code tool).  
Shell scripts are run to install jenkins EC2 server, install Apache Maven, Install Docker.io, Install git and Kubectl Command Line interface. 
In case you are experiencing any trouble provisioning a blue/ocean container Jenkins, you can use this regular jenkins as an alternative. 
It is great in integrating docker, terraform and ansible
